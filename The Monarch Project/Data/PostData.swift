  EventModel(title: "Dreamer Mural", image: "dreamer_mural", description: "We painted a mural to make our community more aware of the immigrants in Sonoma County, their beautiful presence in our community, and the power of unity as one. With the collaboration of Art Start Santa Rosa, Montgomery High Schools art department, and many other organizations, we brought to life the 12 by 32 ft transportable piece. The mural was painted and funded entirely by members of our community, and the mural itself was designed by Rima Makaryan, an immigrant herself, and a member of our team. The mural is now ready for public display, located in a hidden part of Montgomery High School in Santa Rosa. Soon, however, we plan on bringing it to a more accessible"),
  EventModel(title: "Scape Project", image: "for_the_people", description: "This mural celebrates the fierce Sonoma County activist-Dmitra Smith. D’mitra Smith is the former Chair of the Sonoma County Commission on Human Rights, serving from 2012 to August 1, 2020. She was the program manager for the Junior Commission, having mentored over 100 Sonoma County students between 2013- 2020. Smith is a co-founder of the essential workers’ mutual aid collective Food for All – Comida para Todos, and Save Your VI, providing education and advocacy for civil rights protections guaranteed to students nationwide. It was an honor to share the work of someone so deserving of recognition. We worked with our usual Santa Rosa crew along with some wonderful new additions from the around the local neighborhood."),
  EventModel(title: "Art for Armenia", image: "art_armenia", description: "Armenia is a country that has faced challenge after challenge that has crippled many of the structures that are meant to support their people, and the new generation- their young children- are being impacted the hardest. After regional armed conflicts on the brink of genocide, earthquakes, corrupt governments and more, the Armenian people are being kept in a constant state of disempowerment despite the huge strength of their cultural heritage and collective. Villages in Armenia often times have a single school and offer very little opportunity for children to receive quality education let alone be exposed to anything other than agriculture and home keeping. The Monarch Project is aiming to provide arts education and hands on arts activities for children through the principles and framework of public art."),
  EventModel(title: "Nurture Mural", image: "nurture_mural", description: "This piece is all about the importance and beauty of safe spaces in which we can grow, transform, and become the strongest and best versions of ourselves. There are layers of other meanings and symbols hidden in this piece, we encourage you find and create them for yourselves!")
