  EventModelCoded(title: "Art for Armenia", image: "art_armenia", description: "Armenia is a country that has faced challenge after challenge that has crippled many of the structures that are meant to support their people, and the new generation- their young children- are being impacted the hardest. After regional armed conflicts on the brink of genocide, earthquakes, corrupt governments and more, the Armenian people are being kept in a constant state of disempowerment despite the huge strength of their cultural heritage and collective. Villages in Armenia often times have a single school and offer very little opportunity for children to receive quality education let alone be exposed to anything other than agriculture and home keeping. The Monarch Project is aiming to provide arts education and hands on arts activities for children through the principles and framework of public art."),
  EventModelCoded(title: "Nurture Mural", image: "nurture_mural", description: "This piece is all about the importance and beauty of safe spaces in which we can grow, transform, and become the strongest and best versions of ourselves. There are layers of other meanings and symbols hidden in this piece, we encourage you find and create them for yourselves!")
