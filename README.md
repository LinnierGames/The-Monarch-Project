<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I worked together with ‘The Monarch Project’ a non-profit, to create an interactive app for their community. We wanted to create an app where it is minimalistic yet highlighting the best features about the non-profit. 

I created a database using Google’s Firestore to store all the non-profits information. We then gather the information to the app and display the information to the user. This allows the host of the non-profit to update the app as needed. The non-profited wanted a feature where we can see the number of people attending an event. I do this by creating a button so the user can press the join button which increases the amount of attendees inside the database, I then modify the button to appear that they joined after being pressed in and persisting the data after closing the app.


Here's why:
* The non-profits lacks a app were people can view the murals
* Helps people connect with the non-profit in the easiest way possible
* The host of the non-proft can view the number of people attending a certain event
